# Udacity-Investigate-a-Dataset
In this project I will be investigating a dataset and communicate my findings. The aim of this project is to increase my knowledge on Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib. 
I will not be using inferential statistics or machine learning to complete this project. Also the communications that I find are tentative. This is an open-ended project and there is no correct answer.
